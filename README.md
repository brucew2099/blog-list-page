# Blog Listing Application</h1>

## Introduction
### Sample web project: Developing a new blog listing page for the marketing department.


## Specifications
### To complete this sample project, you must build a small web application that __utilizes the Blog Topics API__ specified below to return a list of health care topics.  __Create an API__ that pulls the blog details back for the specified blog topic.  Use your creativity, to design and develop the page.  For the API of the Blog Details, please leverage a CSV file to supply the data to your API.  The CSV file should have common columns: Title, Short Description, Author Name, Topic, Publish Date.

*** For example:
